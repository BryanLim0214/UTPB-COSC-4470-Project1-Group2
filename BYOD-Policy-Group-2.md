**Comprehensive & Secure Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy** 

Version 2.4 | Last Updated: March 1, 2025 

1. **Purpose** 

This policy establishes the framework for the secure and responsible use of personally owned devices for work purposes. It defines the security measures, acceptable use, monitoring mechanisms, and penalties for non-compliance to protect corporate data and systems from unauthorized access, breaches, and data leaks.

The primary objectives of this policy are: 

- To enable employees, contractors, and authorized third parties to use personal devices securely for work purposes.
- To prevent unauthorized access to corporate data through strong security controls.
- To protect corporate networks and systems from malware, cyber threats, and data leaks. 
- To define clear expectations for BYOD users regarding acceptable use and security compliance. 

All users participating in BYOD must review, acknowledge, and comply with this policy. Failure to do so may result in access restrictions, disciplinary actions, or legal consequences, depending on the severity of the violation.

2. **Scope** 

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and third-party vendors who: 

- Access corporate resources, including email, databases, internal applications, and cloud storage. 
- Store, transmit, or process confidential corporate data using personal devices.
- Connect personal devices to the corporate network, including VPNs, internal Wi-Fi, or corporate applications. 

**Scope Limitations:** 

- This policy does not apply to personal devices that are not used for work-related purposes. 
- Employees using corporate-issued devices must follow the Corporate Device Security Policy instead. 
- Any unauthorized use of personal devices to access, store, or process corporate data is strictly prohibited. 
3. **Approved Devices & Operating Systems** 
1. **Allowed Devices** 

To maintain a secure work environment, only the following devices are approved for BYOD access: 

**Smartphones & Tablets:** 

- iOS 16 or later (must support security updates).
- Android 12 or later, with Samsung Knox or Android Enterprise enabled.

**Laptops & Workstations:** 

- Windows 11 Pro or later, with BitLocker encryption enabled.
- macOS Ventura or later, with FileVault encryption enabled.
2. **Prohibited Devices & Configurations** 

The following devices and configurations are strictly prohibited for corporate access due to security risks: 

- Jailbroken/rooted devices that allow unauthorized modifications.
- Windows Home editions, as they lack enterprise security features.
- Devices running outdated or unsupported operating systems without active security patches. 
- Non-MDM enrolled devices that are not compliant with corporate security standards. 
- Devices with unauthorized applications, security modifications, or unapproved remote access tools.

Non-compliant devices will be automatically blocked from accessing corporate resources.

4. **Mandatory Security Measures** 
1. **Authentication & Identity Verification** 

All BYOD devices must comply with strict authentication policies to prevent unauthorized access. 

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is required for all access points, including:

- FIDO2 security keys or 
- TOTP-based authentication apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator). 
- Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition) is permitted as a convenience factor but must be paired with at least one other authentication method. 

SMS-based MFA is strictly prohibited due to its vulnerability to phishing and SIM-swapping attacks. 

**Password Requirements:** 

- Minimum 14-character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. 
- Passwords will only need to be changed if a compromise is suspected or policy updates require it. 
- Company-approved password managers are recommended to help maintain complex, unique passwords.
2. **Device Encryption & Security** 
- Full-disk encryption (FDE) is required for all BYOD devices (BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS). 
- Remote wipe enforcement: Lost, stolen, or compromised devices will be remotely wiped to protect corporate data.
- Auto-lock feature: Devices must lock automatically after 3 minutes of inactivity.
- Failed login policy: After 5 failed login attempts, the device will be locked and require IT approval for reactivation. 
3. **Network & Connectivity** 
- Always-on VPN is required when accessing corporate resources from an external network. 
- Public Wi-Fi usage is strictly prohibited unless a corporate VPN is active.
- Split tunneling is disabled to prevent insecure data transmission.
- Geofencing restrictions: Any attempt to access corporate data from unapproved locations will trigger security alerts and possible access revocation.
5. **Acceptable Use Policy**
