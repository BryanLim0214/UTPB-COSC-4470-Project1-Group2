**Incident Response Policy for Network Security**

Version 1.2 | Last Updated: March 1, 2025 

1. **Purpose** 

This policy establishes a structured approach to detecting, responding to, mitigating, and recovering from security incidents affecting the corporate network. It ensures a swift and effective response to minimize damage, reduce recovery time, and prevent future occurrences. The policy is reviewed quarterly or as needed based on emerging threats to ensure its effectiveness. 

2. **Scope** 

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and any authorized users who: 

- Access corporate networks, systems, or data.
- Use personal or corporate devices to connect to internal or cloud-based company resources. 
- Are responsible for managing, monitoring, or securing IT infrastructure and applications. 

This policy covers all network-related security incidents, including but not limited to unauthorized access, malware infections, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and insider threats. 

3. **Incident Classification** 

Security incidents are classified into four categories based on their severity:

1. **Low-Risk Incidents (Tier 1)** 
- Minor security violations with no direct impact on operations
- Examples: 
  - Isolated failed login attempts below threshold
  - Minor policy violations (e.g., accessing non-business websites) 
  - Attempted access to non-sensitive blocked resources
  - Isolated malware detections that were successfully quarantined
- Response Time: Within 24 hours 
2. **Medium-Risk Incidents (Tier 2)** 
- Potential threats that could escalate if not addressed promptly
- Examples: 
- Multiple failed login attempts from the same source
- Unauthorized device connections to the network
- Suspicious network traffic patterns or data exfiltration attempts
- Detection of potentially unwanted applications
- Non-critical system performance issues indicating possible security problems 
- Response Time: Within 8 hours 
3. **High-Risk Incidents (Tier 3)** 
- Direct threats to network security requiring immediate attention
- Examples: 
  - Confirmed malware infections not automatically remediate 
  - Compromised user credentials or privileged accounts
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
  - Targeted phishing attacks against specific employees
  - Successful exploitation of system vulnerabilities
- Response Time: Within 2 hours 
4. **Critical Incidents (Tier 4)** 
- Major security breaches causing operational disruptions, financial loss, or regulatory violations 
- Examples: 
- Ransomware attacks affecting multiple systems
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) detected within the network
- Major data breaches involving customer or sensitive corporate information
- Widespread system outages due to security incidents
- Coordinated cyber attacks on the organization
- Response Time: Within 15 minutes 
4. **Incident Response Team Structure** 
1. **Core Incident Response Team** 
   1. **Incident Response Manager**: Oversees the entire incident response process
   1. **Network Security Specialists**: Handle technical investigation and containment
   1. **System Administrators**: Assist with system recovery and technical remediation
   1. **Forensic Analysts**: Perform detailed analysis of incidents and evidence collection
1. **Extended Response Team (for High-Risk and Critical Incidents)** 
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Strategic oversight and stakeholder communication 
- **Legal Counsel**: Handles legal implications and regulatory compliance
- **Public Relations**: Manages external communications when needed
- **Human Resources**: Addresses incidents involving employee misconduct
- **Executive Leadership**: Informed and involved in critical incident decisions
5. **Incident Response Phases**
1. **Identification** 
- Users must report any suspected security incidents immediately to the IT Security Team. 
- Automated monitoring tools, including AI-driven threat detection, will log and detect unusual network activities. 
- Security alerts from the following sources will be analyzed:
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system 
- Firewall and network device logs 
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) alerts 
- Cloud security platforms 
2. **Containment** 
1. **Immediate Containment** 
- For minor incidents, network access may be temporarily restricted to prevent escalation. 
- High-risk and critical incidents require immediate isolation of affected devices, accounts, or services. 
- Unauthorized access attempts will trigger automatic session termination and user verification. 
- Potentially compromised accounts will be temporarily locked and require identity verification. 
2. **Short-term Containment** 
- Affected systems will be isolated using network segmentation or removal from the network. 
- Temporary security controls will be implemented to prevent incident spread.
- Access privileges will be adjusted based on the principle of least privilege.
3. **Long-term Containment** 
- Patching and securing systems before returning to production.
- Implementation of additional monitoring for affected systems.
- Hardening of systems based on the attack vector identified.
3. **Eradication** 
- IT Security will analyze the root cause through forensic investigation.
- Malware and unauthorized software will be removed using approved security tools.
- Compromised credentials will be reset and additional authentication factors may be required. 
- Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing will be conducted to verify remediation. 
- For network-based attacks, firewall rules and intrusion prevention system (IPS) policies will be updated. 
- Advanced threats may require: 
- Complete system reimaging 
- Application of security patches and updates
- Removal and replacement of compromised hardware if necessary
4. **Recovery** 
- Affected systems will be restored from known-good backups when necessary.
- Restoration priority will be based on business criticality as defined in the Business Continuity Plan. 
- Before reinstating systems, the following must occur:
  - Security patches must be applied
  - Passwords and access credentials must be reset
  - Multi-factor authentication must be enforced
  - Security configurations must be verified 
- Post-recovery verification will include: 
  - Security scans to confirm threat removal
  - Functionality testing to ensure system operation
  - Continuous monitoring for 72 hours minimum after recovery
- Employees involved in an incident may be required to undergo security training if human error contributed to the breach.
5. **Lessons Learned & Reporting** 
- A detailed post-incident report will be compiled within 5 business days, including:
- Incident timeline and chronology 
- Attack vectors and methodology 
- Impact assessment (operational, financial, reputational)
- Effectiveness of the response
- Recommendations for prevention of similar incidents
- Security posture improvements will be implemented based on findings.
- Existing controls will be evaluated and enhanced as necessary.
- If necessary, legal and compliance teams will be engaged for regulatory reporting.
- Annual tabletop exercises will be conducted to simulate different attack scenarios.
